# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Ultimate Password Strengthening Tool

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The project will help you create a strong passwaord based off of a set amount of criterias. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project will ahve you input a password. It will tell you yo add certain characters and tell you how strong or weak your password is. You will keep being asked to enter a strong password until it meets all of the criteria. Then you will be asked security questions to strengthen the password and allow you access the acount if you ever forgot your password. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We definently accomplish the password strengthening code. I also hope to become more comfortable coding on my own. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

After the password is created, I want another set of code to ask the password, input it incorrectly, then ask the security questions in order to retrieve your password. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

After that, They would have the option to create a new password or keep the old. If new, then run through the entire code again. Finally, I want to become much more confident and comfortable with understanding skills and techniques of coding. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My partner and I will work collaboratively. I think we work better when we are together also, it will simulate working with a coworker in a future career. We will need to work on skills suhc as recognizing charcters in inputs and if/else statements.
